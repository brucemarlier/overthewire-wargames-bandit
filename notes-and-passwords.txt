Notes

bandit1: n/a
bandit2: `-` is being treated as an option/argument to `cat` (or whatever command used to look at the `-` file), terminal is awaiting for user input, specify full path with `./` before `-`
bandit3: the file has blank spaces in it, which need to be 'escaped' with `\` before each blank space
bandit4: the file is hidden, meaning its name starts with `.`, so to uncover it, the option `-a` needs to be specified to the command `ls` to show hidden files/directories
bandit5:
